        "**8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Using logging messages instead of print() statements offers several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Control over log levels:** With logging, you can categorize messages into different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) based on their severity. This allows you to filter messages based on importance, making it easier to debug issues or monitor the application's health.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Flexibility:** You can easily configure logging to direct messages to different destinations such as files, console, network sockets, etc. This flexibility allows you to customize logging behavior based on deployment environments or user preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Timestamps and formatting:** Logging provides built-in support for timestamps and customizable formatting of log messages. This can be helpful for tracking when events occur and standardizing the appearance of log entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Performance:** While print() statements are simple and easy to use, they can significantly impact performance, especially in production environments where large volumes of output are generated. Logging is more efficient and designed to handle logging in a scalable manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Debugging:** Using logging allows you to easily turn on or off specific log levels or modules without modifying the source code. This can be invaluable during debugging or troubleshooting sessions, as you can enable more detailed logging for specific areas of the code without cluttering the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Integration with libraries:** Many third-party libraries use the logging module for their own logging purposes. By using logging consistently throughout your codebase, you can seamlessly integrate with these libraries and have a unified logging approach across your entire application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, using logging messages provides a more robust and flexible approach to handling program output compared to print() statements, particularly in complex or production-level software projects.\n",

        "**Ans:**\n",
        "In a debugger, such as the one provided by many integrated development environments (IDEs) like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code, the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons are used to control the execution flow of your code during debugging. Here are the differences between them:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Step Over:** The Step Over button allows you to execute the current line of code and then pause execution on the next line. If the current line contains a function call, Step Over will execute the entire function without diving into its implementation. It's useful for quickly stepping through code while skipping over function calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Step In:** The Step In button allows you to execute the current line of code and then pause execution on the next line. If the current line contains a function call, Step In will enter the function and pause execution at the first line of that function. It's useful for stepping into the details of function calls to understand their behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Step Out:** The Step Out button allows you to continue execution until the current function is completed and returns to the caller. It's useful when you've stepped into a function call but want to quickly return to the caller and continue debugging from there.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use Step Over to execute the current line and move to the next line without entering function calls.\n",

        "\n",
        "**2. Inspecting Variables:** When execution is paused at a breakpoint, developers can inspect the current values of variables in the program, helping them understand how the program is behaving and diagnose problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Stepping through Code:** Breakpoints can be used in conjunction with debugging controls like \"Step Over,\" \"Step In,\" and \"Step Out\" to step through code one line at a time, examining the program's behavior at each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Testing Specific Code Paths:** By setting breakpoints at different points in the code, developers can test specific code paths and verify that different parts of the program are functioning correctly.\n",
