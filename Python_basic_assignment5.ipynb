        "\n",
        "**1. Structure:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. Keys within a dictionary must be unique, but the values can be duplicated.\n",
        "* A list is an ordered collection of items, where each item is indexed by its position in the list. Lists allow duplicate elements, and the order of elements is maintained.\n",

        "\n",
        "* In a dictionary, elements are accessed by their keys. You provide the key to retrieve the corresponding value.\n",
        "* In a list, elements are accessed by their index position. You provide the index (which starts at 0) to access the element at that position.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Mutability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Both dictionaries and lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after creation. You can add, remove, or modify elements.\n",
        "* However, the way you modify them differs: in a dictionary, you modify elements by their keys, while in a list, you modify elements by their index positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Ordering:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dictionaries do not maintain any specific order for their elements. Starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries retain the insertion order of their keys. Python 3.6 and earlier versions do not guarantee this behavior.\n",
        "* Lists maintain the order of elements as they are inserted.\n",
        "\n",
