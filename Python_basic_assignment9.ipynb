Instead of specifying the complete path from the root directory, a relative path only describes the location of the file or directory relative to the current position. This can make file referencing more flexible and portable, especially when moving files or directories within a filesystem."

It provides a persistent storage mechanism for Python objects, similar to a dictionary, where objects are stored and retrieved using string keys. However, unlike a regular dictionary, a shelf value persists beyond the lifetime of the Python process, making it suitable for simple persistent storage of data between program runs. It is provided by the shelve module in Python."
