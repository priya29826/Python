        "**Q1. What is the purpose of Python&#39;s OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to structure and organize code in a manner that mimics real-world objects and their interactions. Object-oriented programming offers several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modularity:** OOP allows you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces called objects. Each object represents a specific entity with its own attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reuseability:** With OOP, you can create reusable code components. Once you've defined a class (a blueprint for creating objects), you can create multiple instances (objects) of that class throughout your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encapsulation:** OOP encourages encapsulation, which means bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit (object). This helps to keep related code together and prevents unintended external access to an object's internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Abstraction:** OOP supports abstraction, allowing you to hide complex implementation details and only expose necessary features of an object. This makes the code easier to understand and work with.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Inheritance:** OOP supports inheritance, which allows you to create new classes based on existing ones. This promotes code reuse and helps in building hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the purpose of Python's OOP is to provide a flexible and powerful way to design and organize code, making it easier to develop, maintain, and extend complex software systems.\n",

        "**Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** In Python, when you access an attribute (a variable or method) on an object, the interpreter follows a specific order called the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to search for that attribute. When inheritance is involved, the MRO determines the sequence in which base classes are searched for the attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MRO search looks for an attribute in the following order:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The Instance Itself:** First, Python checks if the attribute exists within the instance itself. If it finds the attribute there, it stops searching.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **The Class:** If the attribute is not found in the instance, Python then searches the class of the instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Base Classes:** If the attribute is not found in the class, Python proceeds to search the base classes of the class, following the order specified by the method resolution order (usually defined by the C3 linearization algorithm in Python).\n",
        "\n",
        "The MRO ensures that the search for attributes in inheritance hierarchies follows a predictable and consistent pattern, allowing for effective method and attribute lookup even in complex class structures.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans:** In Python, a class object and an instance object are two different concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Class Object:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A class object in Python serves as a blueprint or a template for creating instances.\n",
        "2. It encapsulates the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that define the behavior of instances.\n",
        "3. Class objects are defined using the class keyword and serve as a namespace for its attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Instance Object:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. An instance object, often referred to simply as an instance, is a concrete realization of a class.\n",
        "2. It represents a specific occurrence of the structure and behavior defined by its class.\n",
        "3. Instances are created by calling the class as if it were a function, resulting in the instantiation of the class and the creation of a unique object.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, class objects provide a means of encapsulating and organizing functionality, facilitating code reuse and maintaining clear separation of concerns. Instance objects, on the other hand, serve as the runtime entities through which the behavior and state defined by the class are realized and manipulated.\n",

        "**Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** In Python, the first argument in a class's method function is conventionally named self, though you can technically name it anything you want, but using self is a widely accepted convention and it's strongly recommended to stick with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "What makes self special is that it represents the instance of the class itself when the method is called. When you call a method on an instance, Python automatically passes that instance as the first argument to the method. This allows the method to access and operate on the instance's attributes and other methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, when you define a method within a class, you must always include self as the first parameter, even though you don't explicitly pass it when calling the method. This is because Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example to illustrate this:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the example, 'self' refers to the instance 'obj' when the 'method' is called. This allows the method to access the 'x' attribute of the instance using 'self.x'."

        "4. **Attribute Binding:** Inside __init__, you can bind instance variables to the object using the self keyword, making them accessible throughout the class.\n",

        "5. **Customization:** You can override __init__ to implement custom initialization logic tailored to your class's specific requirements.\n",
