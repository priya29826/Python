        "**1. What does RGBA stand for?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It's a color model used in digital graphics, particularly in computer graphics and image processing. Let's break down what each component signifies:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Red (R):** This represents the intensity of the red color in the pixel. The value typically ranges from 0 to 255, with 0 indicating no red and 255 indicating maximum intensity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Green (G):** Similar to red, this represents the intensity of the green color in the pixel. Again, the value ranges from 0 to 255.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Blue (B):** Like red and green, blue represents the intensity of the blue color in the pixel, with values ranging from 0 to 255.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Alpha (A):** The alpha channel determines the transparency or opacity of the pixel. It's also represented by a value ranging from 0 to 255, where 0 means fully transparent and 255 means fully opaque. Values in between represent varying degrees of transparency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Combining these four components allows for the representation of a wide range of colors with varying levels of transparency, which is crucial for creating complex and visually appealing graphics in digital media.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans:** In Python imaging libraries like Pillow, a \"box tuple\" is a data structure used to represent a rectangular area within an image. It consists of four integer values that define the coordinates of two opposite corners of the rectangle.\n",
        "\n",
        "The format of a box tuple is (left, top, right, bottom), where:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **left:** The x-coordinate of the left edge of the rectangle.\n",
        "* **top:** The y-coordinate of the top edge of the rectangle.\n",
        "* **right:** The x-coordinate of the right edge of the rectangle.\n",
        "* **bottom:** The y-coordinate of the bottom edge of the rectangle.\n",
        "Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Coordinates:** The (left, top) coordinates represent the top-left corner of the rectangle, while the (right, bottom) coordinates represent the bottom-right corner.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Rectangular Region:** The box tuple defines a rectangular area in the image bounded by the specified coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Usage:** Box tuples are commonly used in image manipulation operations such as cropping, pasting, resizing, and drawing shapes. They serve as a convenient way to specify regions of interest within an image.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when cropping an image, you would use a box tuple to specify the portion of the image you want to keep. Similarly, when drawing a rectangle on an image, you would define the coordinates of the rectangle using a box tuple.\n",
