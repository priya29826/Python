        "**1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** PyInputPlus is a Python module designed to provide easy-to-use functions for taking input from users, with additional validation features. It is not a part of the Python Standard Library, meaning it doesn't come pre-installed with Python itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, PyInputPlus does rely on some modules from the Python Standard Library, such as sys, os, and re for various functionalities. When you install PyInputPlus, these standard library modules are not included as part of the PyInputPlus package; rather, they are already present in your Python environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, to answer your question, while PyInputPlus relies on certain modules from the Python Standard Library for its operation, it is not included with the PyInputPlus package itself. You would need to install PyInputPlus separately if you want to use its functionalities in your Python projects.\n",

        "**2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:**\n",
        "PyInputPlus is commonly imported with the alias pypi for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Convenience:** Using an alias like pypi makes it quicker and easier to refer to PyInputPlus in your code. Typing pypi requires fewer characters and is more concise compared to typing out pyinputplus every time you need to use it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Readability:** Shorter aliases can improve the readability of your code, especially when you need to use PyInputPlus functions multiple times within the same script or module. It reduces visual clutter and makes the code cleaner and more streamlined.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Avoiding Name Collisions:** Using a distinct alias like pypi helps prevent naming conflicts with other modules or variables in your codebase. If you have another module or variable named pyinputplus or something similar, using an alias ensures that there won't be any confusion or unintended behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Consistency:** Adopting a standard alias like pypi across your codebase promotes consistency and makes it easier for other developers to understand and navigate your code. When multiple developers are working on the same project, having consistent naming conventions can enhance collaboration and reduce potential errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Namespace Clarity:** While Python namespaces generally mitigate the risk of naming conflicts, using aliases like pypi provides additional clarity about the origin of the functions or classes being used. It explicitly indicates that the imported functionality is from PyInputPlus, which can be helpful when reviewing or maintaining the code later on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, importing PyInputPlus with the alias pypi strikes a balance between brevity, readability, and clarity, contributing to more efficient and maintainable Python code.\n",

        "**3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** In PyInputPlus, inputInt() and inputFloat() are two different functions used for taking input from the user and ensuring that the input is of a specific type: integer or floating-point number, respectively. Here's how you can distinguish between them:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Input Type Expectation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **inputInt():** Expects the user to input an integer value. If the user enters a non-integer value, PyInputPlus will reprompt them until they provide a valid integer input.\n",
        "* **inputFloat():** Expects the user to input a floating-point (decimal) value. Similar to inputInt(), if the user enters a non-floating-point value, PyInputPlus will reprompt them until they provide a valid floating-point input.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Return Type:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **inputInt():** Returns the user's input as an integer type.\n",
        "* **inputFloat():** Returns the user's input as a float type.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Handling Non-Numeric Input:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Both functions handle cases where the user enters non-numeric input differently:\n",
        "  * inputInt(): If the user enters a non-integer value, PyInputPlus will display an error message and prompt the user again until they provide a valid integer input.\n",
        "  * inputFloat(): Similarly, if the user enters a non-floating-point value, PyInputPlus will display an error message and prompt the user again until they provide a valid floating-point input.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Optional Parameters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Both functions accept optional parameters to customize their behavior, such as minimum and maximum values, allowing certain types of inputs, custom validation functions, and more. These parameters can be used to further refine the input requirements based on your specific use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Usage Context:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* inputInt() and inputFloat() are typically used in scenarios where you specifically need integers or floating-point numbers as input from the user. For example, when prompting the user to enter their age (inputInt()), or when asking for a measurement in meters (inputFloat()).\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, inputInt() and inputFloat() serve distinct purposes: inputInt() is for handling integer input, while inputFloat() is for handling floating-point input. They ensure type safety and provide a user-friendly way to interactively collect numeric data from users in Python applications."

        "\n",
        "**Ans:** You can use PyInputPlus's inputInt() function with its built-in validation capabilities to ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "**1. allowRegexes:**\n",

        "* If a value entered by the user matches any of the regular expressions in allowRegexes, it is considered valid, and PyInputPlus accepts it.\n",
        "* If the allowRegexes argument is provided, PyInputPlus will only accept input values that match one of the specified regular expressions.\n",
        "* If the input value does not match any of the regular expressions in allowRegexes, PyInputPlus will reject it and prompt the user to enter a new value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. blockRegexes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* This argument also accepts a list of regular expressions.\n",
        "* Each regular expression in blockRegexes specifies a pattern that input values must not match to be considered valid.\n",
        "* If a value entered by the user matches any of the regular expressions in blockRegexes, it is considered invalid, and PyInputPlus rejects it.\n",
        "* If the blockRegexes argument is provided, PyInputPlus will reject input values that match any of the specified regular expressions.\n",
        "* If the input value matches any of the regular expressions in blockRegexes, PyInputPlus will prompt the user to enter a new value.\n",
        "\n",
